This FMU is generated in Hopsan and contains a model of a hydraulic position servo with a PI controller. Input is the reference (desired) position, and outouts are the position and the speed of the piston. 

The FMU uses FMI for co-simulation. It supports variable communication step size, but not getting and setting FMU states.
